# LotusScripts
These LotusScript files contain utilities I used in a past life when Domino ruled the collabrative RAD space.  I am only putting them up here as a sort of historical archive.  Like a digital time capsule that contains an historic cache of utilities and functions intended as a method of communication with future people and to a record for future developers, digital archaeologists, digital anthropologists, or digital historians ;-)
