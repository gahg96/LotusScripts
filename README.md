# LotusScripts
These LotusScript files contain utilities I used in a past life when Domino ruled the collabrative RAD space.  I am only putting them up here as a sort of historical archive.  Like a digital time capsule that contains an historic cache of utilities and functions intended as a method of communication with future people and to a record for future developers, digital archaeologists, digital anthropologists, or digital historians ;-)

AgentLib.lss
This file contains the code that needs to be added to a script library for agent logging.  Call the OpenAgentLog function so that agent processing may be recorded.  Please add an events form to track the logging

QuickSort.lss
Functions to implement sortying in Lotus Script
